🌟 WORLD-BUILDING

> exploring the complex world of ITM
From the void to the higher dimensions

---

📍 CORE SETTING

ITM takes place entirely within a unique universe called The Void.

The Void is not empty — it’s an unstable, sentient world of raw creative energy.

A place where imagination lives, decays, and restarts in a constant, violent cycle.

It is not a bridge between worlds. It is the main universe.


> The Void is alive.
The Void is cruel.
The Void is amused by your suffering.




---

🧱 STRUCTURE OF THE VOID
The Void has zones, not continents — artistic layers instead of geography:

1. Idea Fields – Raw, drifting concepts. Nothing is finished here. Time doesn’t know how to tick.


2. Sketch Realms – Semi-solid spaces based on design ideas. Shaky perspective, fluctuating mass.


3. Inklands – Finished styles clashing together. Pop-art next to horror, pixel next to realism.


4. Doodlevile – A town made by Creator and Creatia, a place for their OCs to live and hang out.

🧠 THE ASCENDED REALM

Home of the Overseers.

An unreachable dimension where creators, artists, and architects of imagination reside.

It’s not part of the story’s setting.

When something is forgotten or untouched, it fades away.




---

🔄 ITERATIONS

The world exists in cycles called Iterations.

Each Iteration is:

A unique version of the world

Governed by a new mix of rules, designs, and emotional logic

Destined to collapse once its creative structure becomes too unstable



---

🧨 CYCLIC LOGIC

Each Iteration ends when:

The logic becomes unsustainable

The world reaches a point called the multiversal collapse

It is when The world reaches a point beyond infinity

Then, the world compresses into a single point — the only remaining existence


That point becomes the container of all universes, multiverses, timelines, and realities.
The space that inhabits and surrounds that point is called the Omnivoid — or, in truer terms: the Omniverse.

> Then, the world implodes.
Reality rebuilds it — differently.
Some remember. Most do not.
But the pattern always continues.

---

> Forgotten.
That is everything this world is.
Thousands — no, an infinite number— of created multiverses fill the cosmos.

---

> This is IN THEIR MINDS
